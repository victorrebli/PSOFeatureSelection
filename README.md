# PSOFeatureSelection

Particle swarm Optmization(PSO) simulates the social behaviour such as birds flockingand fish schooling. In PSO, a population, also called a swarm, of can-didate solutions are encoded as particles in the search space. PSOstarts with the random initialisation of a population of particles.Particles move in the search space to search for the optimal solutionby updating the position of each particle based on the experienceof its own and its neighbouring particles

This is the implementation of the paper:
